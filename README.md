INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE AND GET THE GAME RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY

WORDS FILE

This program uses a binary file called "words.dat" that contains the words that the player has to guess.
In order for this game to run correctly, the file "words.dat" must be in the same directory as the executable file after compilation.

COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS

1.	You need to compile this game with a compiler that allows compilation under C++11 standard or later version.

2.	"Main.cpp", "Hangman.h", "Hangman.cpp", and "Word.h" must all be in the same directory before compilation.

3.	Compile Main.cpp and Hangman.cpp into an executable.

4.	Make sure that the executable just created is in the same directory as the "words.dat" file.

5.	Run the executable.
